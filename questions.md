## Question
How does God judge secular or atheistic scientists/entrepreneurs/leaders etc. that have done so much good for society, and whose creations are even used by many Muslims all around the world? How are the Muslims that use these technologies judged?

## Thoughts
To me, it seems unjust to punish men such as Elon Musk, who are openly atheist, when their technologies are used by hundreds of millions of people all around the world, not to mention many Muslims. Furthermore, I think their intentions are generally good for the most part; they want to create value for and serve society at large. Then to me, it would be only logical that if Allah ultimately punishes Elon Musk, then people like me that use such technologies created from secular motives would also be ruthlessly punished. But this doesn't seem right to me, and Allah is the most Fair, most Merciful. If He truly is, then I think it would be just to admit these men to Paradise, even though they were not followers of Islam, but I also know that Islam emphasizes the importance of Tahwid, the belief in one God, and atheism is seen as a grave sin.

At the same time, from my view, there are so many sins that plague us every day, from missing prayers, to engaging in vain thoughts and behaviors, to lust, to eating impure foods, and one could even argue using technology that was created using slave (or close to it) labor. I guess my point is that there are so many sins that one can engage in that sometimes it's not clear to me what one should be focusing on in terms of living a life that is pleasing to Allah.

Are men like Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr. going to Hell since they were not Muslism? Ultimately, my understanding is that decision is up to Allah and Allah alone, and one should not play the role of God in saying that these men are going to Hell since we know nothing compared to Allah. 

I guess ultimately what this question is getting at is wrestling with better understanding the Judgment scale of God. How does he weigh the good one does versus the evil one does, and where do all of the sins mentioned in the religion fall in that spectrum? 

As a thought experiment, if I was in a position where I had a choice of praying to Allah or perhaps helping someone in need, such as a family member, what should I do? At what point does it become more pleasing to Allah to do skip the prayer, or should this be avoided under all circumstances? Will I be punished for deilberately skipping prayers if I am in the process of learning more about the religion and earnestly making an effort to clear uncertainties I have?

I like to believe that Allah judges us based on our intentions, but I guess I am still not quite satisfied, because it is not clear to me what constitutes good intentions versus bad intentions in a Qur'anic context, and there is another part of me that truly believes that no one deep down has bad intentions, and that if we were in their shoes, we would behave exactly the same as them. Fundamentally, we are all humans capable of doing immense evil and also doing immense good, and different situations and environmental stimuli can cause us to act more in one direction or another, but we never really intend to hurt anyone that we care about. From our own lens, all of our actions seem justified. When judging a human, how does God take this into account?
